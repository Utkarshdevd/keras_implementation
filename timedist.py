class TimeDistributed(KerasTimeDistributed):
    """
    This class fixes two bugs in Keras: (1) the input mask is not passed to the wrapped layer, and
    (2) Keras' TimeDistributed currently only allows a single input, not a list.  We currently
    don't handle the case where the _output_ of the wrapped layer is a list, however.  (Not that
    that's particularly hard, we just haven't needed it yet, so haven't implemented it.)
    Notes
    -----
    If the output shape for TimeDistributed has a final dimension of 1, we essentially sqeeze it,
    reshaping to have one fewer dimension.  That change takes place in the actual ``call`` method as well as
    the ``compute_output_shape`` method.
